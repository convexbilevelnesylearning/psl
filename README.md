PSL for running the experiment scripts for the paper "Convex and Bilevel Optimization for Neuro-Symbolic Inference and Learning".

Installing PSL from Source
--------------------------

If you do want to install PSL from source, you can use [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) 3.x.
In the top-level directory of the PSL source (which should be the same directory that holds this README), run:
```sh
mvn install
```
